# Machine learning
- Pattern finding, clustering the data
# Problems with machine learning
- Not handle text data, image data
- Overfitting and Underfitting


### machine learning
- Input data => feature extraction (by manual) => Model (Classification/ Regression) => Output
- Vast number of Classifiers

### Deep Learning
- Input Data => feature extraction and classification (automatic model development) => Output
- Representation ML is called Deep Learning
- Limited number of Classifiers

- Application:
  - Computer Vision: Object Localization, Face Detection, Object Detection
  - NLP: Semantic analysis,  Word2Vec
  - Speech: WaveNet
  - Text Summarization
  - GamePlay: Alpha Go, Combination Deep Q learning to play Atari
  - Spam detection: Detecting fraud emails
  - Medical data analysis
  - Data Compression
  - Anomaly Detection
  - Digital advertising and customer targeting


### Neural Network
- How NN is better than traditional ML
  - Automatic feature extraction and deriving relation between input to output
  - large data source
  - more computation and GPU
- How is bettre than ML
  - 
- What NN takes 

### Artificial Neural Networks:
- ANN contains multiple layers of artificial neurons.
- The first layer is the input layer (in)and the last layer in output layer(on)
- The rest of the inner layers are referred to as hidden layers.
- These are the layers where magic happens; I mean pooling, subsampling, activation, dropout, convolution, compression of data
### Deep learning
- Basically, we refer Deep learning as Learning done by an Artificial Neural network which has more than one hidden layer.
- The intuition is as deep the network is the deeper representation present in data could be extracted
- Can work well with noisy or incomplete data as well, given enough data to learn the underlying function


### The data propagation in a forward pass is named as Feed-Forward Networks
- Dense connected means fully connected
## Tensorflow
- TensorFlowâ„¢ is an open-source software library by Google for high-performance numerical computation
- Its flexible architecture allows easy deployment of computation across a variety of platforms (CPUs, GPUs, TPUs), and from desktops to clusters of servers to mobile and edge devices
- Originally developed by researchers at Google Brain and was being used by internal teams at Google
- Optimized for Deep Neural Networks
