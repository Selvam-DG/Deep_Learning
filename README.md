# Machine learning
- Pattern finding, clustering the data
# Problems with machine learning
- Not handle text data, image data
- Overfitting and Underfitting


### machine learning
- Input data => feature extraction (by manual) => Model (Classification/ Regression) => Output
- Vast number of Classifiers

### Deep Learning
- Input Data => feature extraction and classification (automatic model development) => Output
- Representation ML is called Deep Learning
- Limited number of Classifiers

### Neural Network
- How NN is better than traditional ML
  - Automatic feature extraction and deriving relation between input to output
  - large data source
  - more computation and GPU
- How is bettre than ML
  - 
- What NN takes 

## Neural Networks:
- Pattern Recognizer
